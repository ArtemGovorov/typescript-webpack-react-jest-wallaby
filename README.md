Sample for wallabyjs issue 1024

I would like to keep the configuration options set for the project, and use wallabyjs.

Wallabyjs is just the greatest help for testing our frontend code. We are eagerly awaiting the possibility to run it in our CI environment.

# How to use:

Run the following commands:

1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. npm test

1 test should fail, and 2 should pass.

Then open in visual studio, and start wallabyjs.
Expected result should be the same.
